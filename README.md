# RemoteVisualAssistant


This project aims to create a solution to provide VI persons a medium via which they can communicate and acquire help from their friends and family, or volunteers in completing different tasks at hand. This is done by sharing a live video stream via an eyepiece mounted over VI userâ€™s spectacles, the live location stream of the VI user and a voice call to the volunteer, using which the volunteer can guide the VI user. Primary objective includes designing and developing an android mobile application for communication between VI user and volunteer, also designing an eyepiece for the volunteer.
